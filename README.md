Awesome dotfiles repo
=====================

Well, probably it's not...

At the moment of writing this lines, there is only config of two of my dotfile
apps, Macvim and Fish shell.

Fish shell config is under config/fish, And Vim config is under vim.

To get the dotfiles:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/jlgarhdez/dotfiles.git
$ cd dotfiles
$ git submodule init
$ git submodule update
```
